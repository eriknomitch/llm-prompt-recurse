# llm-prompt-recurse

_NOTE_: This is my personal repo for testing prompt recursion in LLM. You can use this as a reference to implement prompt recursion in your own LLM fork.

This is based off of [langsmith-cookbook/assisted-prompt-engineering](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-cookbook/blob/main/optimization/assisted-prompt-bootstrapping/assisted-prompt-engineering.ipynb).
