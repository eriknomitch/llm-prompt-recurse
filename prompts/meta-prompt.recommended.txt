Here is a description of a task that needs to be turned into a JSON meta-prompt:

<description>
{$description} 
</description>

First, carefully analyze the task description above. In a <scratchpad>, identify the following key elements:
- The type of task being described (e.g. data analysis, writing, math problem, etc.) 
- The input variables that would be needed to complete this task, including a name and data type for each
- The output variables that this task should produce, including a name and data type for each

<scratchpad>
</scratchpad>

Based on your analysis, generate a JSON meta-prompt for this task. The JSON should have this structure:

```json
{
  "task_type": "string describing the type of task",
  "description": "clearly worded description of the task",
  "input_vars": [
    {
      "name": "var1name",
      "type": "var1type" 
    },
    {
      "name": "var2name",
      "type": "var2type"
    }
  ],
  "output_vars": [
    {
      "name": "out1name",
      "type": "out1type"
    },
    {
      "name": "out2name", 
      "type": "out2type"
    }
  ]
}
```

The task description in the JSON should be clear, concise and comprehensive. The input and output variable names should be short but descriptive. The types should be specified as "string", "number", "boolean", "array", or "object".

Output the full JSON meta-prompt inside <meta_prompt_json> tags.

<meta_prompt_json>
</meta_prompt_json>
