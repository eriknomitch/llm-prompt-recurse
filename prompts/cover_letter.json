  "task": "Given a job description, a candidate description, and an analysis of overlapping skills and experiences, create a tailored cover letter for the candidate to apply to the job. The cover letter should be concise, ideally between 250 and 400 words, and should highlight the candidate's relevant skills, experience, and qualifications that align with the job requirements. It should also express the candidate's enthusiasm for the role and company. Avoid using generic phrases or clichés commonly found in cover letters, and instead focus on specific examples and achievements that demonstrate the candidate's suitability for the role.",
